We are trying to address:

1. UX: More friendly open-source paymaster framework for the Ethereum community.
   1. Beyond the business paymaster, we have UX innovations like gas cards, ENS, and more.
2. Cost: One-key deployment script is free for all the Ethereum ecosystem partners, end users can get free gas payment from project launchers.
3. Security: We add D2FA, and TrustNet based on secure enclave mode.
4. Long-term adaptability with Ethereum: AAStar will focus on the AA roadmap of  Ethereum, follow the ERC4337, EIP7702, RIP7560, and more EIPs, and make the EIP into real solutions.
